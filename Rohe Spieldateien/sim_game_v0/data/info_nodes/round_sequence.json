After pressing the \"Continue to next round\" Button, wait a short time (like a second) for the next turn to be loaded properly.\nIn the first round, you won't be able to produce chocolate, bcause you'll need contracts first. Dont fire your employees though, you'll need them sooner than they could be rehired.\n\nCheck every tab (especially your contracts) every turn, it's easy to miss stuff\n\nThis game is a Rogue-lite. So if you run out of Money it's game over, immediately. Once you lose, the save will be deleted, so be careful.",
